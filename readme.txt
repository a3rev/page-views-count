Places an icon, all time views count and views today count at the bottom of posts, pages and custom post types on any WordPress website.

== DESCRIPTION ==

A beautifully simple to set up plugin that gives site visitors and site owners the ability to quickly and easily see how many people have visited that page or post. 

= FEATURES =

* On the front end it adds an icon and page views count to the bottom or top of pages and posts on your WordPress website.
* Switch ON | OFF hide Page Views Count for all Posts, Pages and all custom posts types including WooCommerce and WP e-Commerce custom post types.
* Set the Position of the counter to show at the top of the page or post or at the bottom
* Set alignment of the counter Left, Right or Centre
* Set the colour and size of the counter icon
* Option to use load by Ajax to prevent the count from being cached by caching plugins 
* Option to Manually set / edit total views and views today from Page View Count meta box on any post or page editor
* Lightweight - Fontawesome icon (no image to load) and called via WordPress JSON RESTful API (not on ajax-admin.php)
* All options and settings are point click - absolutely no coding required  

= DEVELOPERS =

On the plugins dashboard in the + Page Views Count Function options box you will find the Page Views Count functions and notes on how to use them. 

* Use to manually add Page views count to any content or object in the theme. 
* Use to add page View Count to any content that is not create using WordPress custom post / taxonomy type. 
* Use to create a custom position of the Page Views Count 
* Functions support echo and return parameters when getting visitor stats on any variable.

= TROUBLESHOOTING =

* The number 1 support request we get about the plugin is that it double or triple counts page or post loads. Yes it does and if you see that it is a Red Flag that you have a misconfiguration or bug in your theme or a plugin. Page Views Count does exactly that - counts each time the page or post is loading in the browser - if its counting twice it is because the browser is double loading the page. That is a bad thing and you or your developer needs to fix that.
